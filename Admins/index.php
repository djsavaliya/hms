	<p style="margin-left: 50px;margin-right: 50px">A hostel is a form of low-cost, short-term shared sociable lodging where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed in a dormitory, with shared use of a lounge and sometimes a kitchen. Rooms can be mixed or single-sex and have private or shared bathrooms. Private rooms may also be available, but the property must offer dormitories to be considered a hostel.Hostels are popular forms of lodging for backpackers, cycle tourists, and gap year travelers. They are part of the sharing economy.Benefits of hostels include lower costs and opportunities to meet people from all over the world, find travel partners, and share travel ideas.</p>
